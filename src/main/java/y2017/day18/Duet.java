    /**
     * You discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled simply "Duet".
     * Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code yourself.
     * Unfortunately, you don't see any documentation, so you're left to figure out what the instructions mean on your own.
     * <p>
     * It seems like the assembly is meant to operate on a set of registers that are each named with
     * a single letter and that can each hold a single integer. You suppose each register should start with a value of 0.
     * <p>
     * There aren't that many instructions, so it shouldn't be hard to figure out what they do. Here's what you determine:
     * <p>
     * snd X plays a sound with a frequency equal to the value of X.
     * set X Y sets register X to the value of Y.
     * add X Y increases register X by the value of Y.
     * mul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value contained in register X by the value of Y.
     * mod X Y sets register X to the remainder of dividing the value contained in register X by the value of Y (that is, it sets X to the result of X modulo Y).
     * rcv X recovers the frequency of the last sound played, but only when the value of X is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does nothing.)
     * jgz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is greater than zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instructionType, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instructionType, and so on.)
     * <p>
     * Many of the instructions can take either a register (a single letter) or a number.
     * The value of a register is the integer it contains; the value of a number is that number.
     * <p>
     * After each jump instructionType, the program continues with the instructionType to which the jump jumped.
     * After any other instructionType, the program continues with the next instructionType.
     * Continuing (or jumping) off either end of the program terminates it.
     * <p>
     * For example:
     * <p>
     * set a 1
     * add a 2
     * mul a a
     * mod a 5
     * snd a
     * set a 0
     * rcv a
     * jgz a -1
     * set a 1
     * jgz a -2
     * The first four instructions set a to 1, add 2 to it, square it, and then set it to itself modulo 5, resulting in a value of 4.
     * Then, a sound with frequency 4 (the value of a) is played.
     * After that, a is set to 0, causing the subsequent rcv and jgz instructions to both be skipped (rcv because a is 0, and jgz because a is not greater than 0).
     * Finally, a is set to 1, causing the next jgz instructionType to activate, jumping back two instructions to another jump, which jumps again to the rcv, which ultimately triggers the recover operation.
     * At the time the recover operation is executed, the frequency of the last sound played is 4.
     * <p>
     * What is the value of the recovered frequency (the value of the most recently played sound) the first time a rcv instructionType is executed with a non-zero value?

    /**
     * As you congratulate yourself for a job well done, you notice that the documentation has been on the back of the tablet this entire time. While you actually got most of the instructions correct, there are a few key differences. This assembly code isn't about sound at all - it's meant to be run twice at the same time.
     * <p>
     * Each running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run at the same speed.
     * To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv) instructions:
     * <p>
     * snd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in a queue until that program is ready to receive them.
     * Each program has its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it sent.
     * <p>
     * rcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.
     * Each program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1); the register p should begin with this value.
     * <p>
     * For example:
     * <p>
     * snd 1
     * snd 2
     * snd p
     * rcv a
     * rcv b
     * rcv c
     * rcv d
     * <p>
     * Both programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b, and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0 receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees a different value in its own copy of register c.
     * <p>
     * Finally, both programs try to rcv a fourth time, but no data is waiting for either of them, and they reach a deadlock. When this happens, both programs terminate.
     * <p>
     * It should be noted that it would be equally valid for the programs to run at different speeds; for example, program 0 might have sent all three values and then stopped at the first rcv before program 1 executed even its first instruction.
     * <p>
     * Once both of your programs have terminated (regardless of what caused them to do so), how many times did program 1 send a value?
